# NLP-Based Turkish Song Lyric Synthesizing

This project aims to synthesize Turkish song lyrics using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The project is divided into four main components:

1. **Web Scraping for Song Lyrics**: A Python script that scrapes song lyrics from the website `https://www.sarkisozleri.bbs.tr`. The scraped lyrics are then saved in a JSON format, categorized by their detected language.

2. **NLP Model**: A set of Python scripts that train and control an NLP model for lyric synthesis.

3. **Desktop Application**: A Python-based desktop application that interacts with the NLP model to generate song lyrics based on user input.

4. **Prompt Automation**: A C# application that automates the process of generating prompts for the NLP model.

## Features

- **Song URL Collection**: The script collects URLs of songs from the target website and saves them in a CSV file.
  
- **Lyric Scraping**: The lyrics of the songs are scraped and saved in a JSON format. The lyrics are categorized based on their detected language (Turkish, English, German, or Unknown).

- **NLP Model Training and Control**: The NLP model can be trained using the collected lyrics and can be controlled to generate synthesized lyrics.

- **Desktop Application Interface**: Users can interact with the NLP model through a desktop application to generate song lyrics.

- **Prompt Automation**: Automates the process of generating prompts for the NLP model using a C# application.
